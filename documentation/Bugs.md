The bugs are mainly categorised based on Functional and UI/UX
# Prioritization
1. Look and Feel => UI/UX
2. Functional

Definitely look and feel is very important but from my persective if functionality is breaking it has more priority than other bugs

All Functional bugs are identified and automated as part of UI feature => features/caseJudgementUi.feature

# Functional:
If I have more time: page navigation issue
Navigations is quite hard for example when user change mind after selecting a case he cant go back immediately neither by browser nor from application

# UI/UX Bugs
1. Image positions across pupups
2. Buttons
3. CASE STUDY: EYEWITNESS
